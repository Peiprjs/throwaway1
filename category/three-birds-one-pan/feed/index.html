<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>——Diary of Katie Claudsson, 01/01/2022——</strong></p>



<p>New year new me! Welcome 2022, let’s hope nothing goes south this year… The last two have been crazy. The first term in uni has been going… well, let’s just say it’s been going. I didn’t get full marks, but I have made a promise to myself, to my parents and to my professors. To help me with that quest, I have decided to start going to the swimming pool; I read a paper which concluded that exercise helps with studying, but I still have to take care of bureaucracy, it’s too complicated to figure this out.</p>



<p>I will take it slow since we are on holiday for another week, so I’ll use this time to fix stuff around the house. Let’s get this show on the road!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>————————————————</strong></p>



<p>“Where the fuck did I leave the broom?” I exclaim, as I discover a giant spider web right beside my table. It was right where I had left it the last time I had used it: beside the fridge. My brain has a really hard time remembering things sometimes. Yesterday I almost locked myself out, and the day before I almost left the groceries at the store because I forgot about them after paying.</p>



<p>I open my trusty ePod and bop along to my favourite music while I clean up. There is a lot of filth after only two weeks of not cleaning. After just over six hours of work, for everything looks presentable, and my batteries are almost dead, so I am treating myself to a doughnut and coffee.</p>



<p>I grab my phone, my wallet, my mask and (this time I did not forget) the keys and head for the door. Tom Mortons is right around the corner. I don’t expect to take over ten minutes, because I already have in mind what I want: the chocolate-filled one with sprinkles on top and a large American coffee with chocolate.</p>



<p>I get in, head to the counter and wait in line for a bit. The cashier steps out to get a call, so his colleague takes over. My turn arrives, and I say my order without thinking. The guy, with a badge that says Mark, smiles and asks if that’s all. I instinctively say “With card, please”, robot mode still on. He chuckles and I snap out of whatever mental fog I was in. He is very cute, with short black hair and wireframe glasses. I pay and he gives me the receipt, along with a polite “Thank you for your visit”. I go over to the order pickup station, grab my snack, and sit down on one of those super comfy sofas. This is life.</p>



<p>I open my phone and start writing. As much as I’d love to, fanfics won’t write themselves yet. I immediately get sidetracked as I receive a new comment on my best story, Potatobros. It says it helped them find out their sexuality. I seem to guide others to a treasure I cannot possess. I eye the cute barista cleaning the tables on my right, and my heart suddenly skips a beat. Great, now that I thought I was a lesbian 100%. Guess I will have to think about it, again.</p>

<p>So there I was, browsing r/egg_irl like the egg I am, and stumbled across this Tumblr post. And as such, I put my brain to work.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not going to be two, it&#8217;s going to be three: boymode, girlmode and andromode. This could make it or break it, IDK. The story is going to be written by an internal narrator, from the point of view of Katie Claudsson, the female main character. It&#8217;s going to be roughly equiparable to real time, in an unimportant location.</p>



<p>I expect the story to have two main seasons: &#8220;Birds of a feather&#8221; and &#8220;Birds of a nest&#8221;. You can guess how they go.</p>
