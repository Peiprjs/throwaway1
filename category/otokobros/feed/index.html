<p>Hi so I decided to start this project out kind of strong with a pretty weird gay, trans, self-discovery story. Let me just get you up to speed with what my mind has created. Also first of all let me apologise as I have no idea how the fuck this all came into existence, and I have this virtual whiteboard with all the ideas and it&#8217;s a mess and it changes constantly&#8230; Please bear with me.</p>



<p>The main characters of this story are two: Pauline and Mark (previously Paul and Marcy). They are both fraternal twins, about 16 years old (kinda needed them to be this age so they still live with parents but can move out pretty soon), and both are trans. Pauline would be demi pan and Mark would be vanilla gay. Some parts of each character may be based on me.<br>Then there&#8217;s the parents. They are not comprehensive at all (or are they? Not gonna spoil it but I have an idea that would make it kinda better in the future), maybe even going a bit too far. <br>And on the other side of the scale we have the big brother, who would be 20 years old, and genderfluid asexual biromantic.<br>Now we get to a much more funny part I guess? All four grandparents are super healthy. We have the mother&#8217;s mother, who is exactly like her. Then we have the mother&#8217;s father, who is secretly gay and dating the father&#8217;s father, who is married to the father&#8217;s mother (and had a child with her) in order to hide their sexuality, as she is a lesbian (they had to hide it because old-times) and has a girlfriend.</p>



<p>Now let&#8217;s talk time. The story will start around December 2021, exactly the same time as it launches and it will progress at approximately the same pace as reality.</p>



<p>And the space-time continuum can&#8217;t work without space so let&#8217;s talk locations. The story will take place canonically in Catalonia, except maybe for vacations (although IDK if they are actually going to go abroad). The two brothers and two parents will live in the northern city of Girona, while the big brother and the mother&#8217;s parents will live in Barcelona, the capital. The father&#8217;s parents will live in a grape farm in the South, and the mother&#8217;s father will spend most of the time working there.</p>



<p>I hope everything makes sense and it isn&#8217;t a bit overkill or anything. Any suggestion you may have, direct it to me (contact details are in the footer)</p>
