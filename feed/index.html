<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>——Diary of Katie Claudsson, 01/01/2022——</strong></p>



<p>New year new me! Welcome 2022, let’s hope nothing goes south this year… The last two have been crazy. The first term in uni has been going… well, let’s just say it’s been going. I didn’t get full marks, but I have made a promise to myself, to my parents and to my professors. To help me with that quest, I have decided to start going to the swimming pool; I read a paper which concluded that exercise helps with studying, but I still have to take care of bureaucracy, it’s too complicated to figure this out.</p>



<p>I will take it slow since we are on holiday for another week, so I’ll use this time to fix stuff around the house. Let’s get this show on the road!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>————————————————</strong></p>



<p>“Where the fuck did I leave the broom?” I exclaim, as I discover a giant spider web right beside my table. It was right where I had left it the last time I had used it: beside the fridge. My brain has a really hard time remembering things sometimes. Yesterday I almost locked myself out, and the day before I almost left the groceries at the store because I forgot about them after paying.</p>



<p>I open my trusty ePod and bop along to my favourite music while I clean up. There is a lot of filth after only two weeks of not cleaning. After just over six hours of work, for everything looks presentable, and my batteries are almost dead, so I am treating myself to a doughnut and coffee.</p>



<p>I grab my phone, my wallet, my mask and (this time I did not forget) the keys and head for the door. Tom Mortons is right around the corner. I don’t expect to take over ten minutes, because I already have in mind what I want: the chocolate-filled one with sprinkles on top and a large American coffee with chocolate.</p>



<p>I get in, head to the counter and wait in line for a bit. The cashier steps out to get a call, so his colleague takes over. My turn arrives, and I say my order without thinking. The guy, with a badge that says Mark, smiles and asks if that’s all. I instinctively say “With card, please”, robot mode still on. He chuckles and I snap out of whatever mental fog I was in. He is very cute, with short black hair and wireframe glasses. I pay and he gives me the receipt, along with a polite “Thank you for your visit”. I go over to the order pickup station, grab my snack, and sit down on one of those super comfy sofas. This is life.</p>



<p>I open my phone and start writing. As much as I’d love to, fanfics won’t write themselves yet. I immediately get sidetracked as I receive a new comment on my best story, Potatobros. It says it helped them find out their sexuality. I seem to guide others to a treasure I cannot possess. I eye the cute barista cleaning the tables on my right, and my heart suddenly skips a beat. Great, now that I thought I was a lesbian 100%. Guess I will have to think about it, again.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not going to be two, it&#8217;s going to be three: boymode, girlmode and andromode. This could make it or break it, IDK. The story is going to be written by an internal narrator, from the point of view of Katie Claudsson, the female main character. It&#8217;s going to be roughly equiparable to real time, in an unimportant location.</p>



<p>I expect the story to have two main seasons: &#8220;Birds of a feather&#8221; and &#8220;Birds of a nest&#8221;. You can guess how they go.</p>

<p>Hi so I decided to start this project out kind of strong with a pretty weird gay, trans, self-discovery story. Let me just get you up to speed with what my mind has created. Also first of all let me apologise as I have no idea how the fuck this all came into existence, and I have this virtual whiteboard with all the ideas and it&#8217;s a mess and it changes constantly&#8230; Please bear with me.</p>



<p>The main characters of this story are two: Pauline and Mark (previously Paul and Marcy). They are both fraternal twins, about 16 years old (kinda needed them to be this age so they still live with parents but can move out pretty soon), and both are trans. Pauline would be demi pan and Mark would be vanilla gay. Some parts of each character may be based on me.<br>Then there&#8217;s the parents. They are not comprehensive at all (or are they? Not gonna spoil it but I have an idea that would make it kinda better in the future), maybe even going a bit too far. <br>And on the other side of the scale we have the big brother, who would be 20 years old, and genderfluid asexual biromantic.<br>Now we get to a much more funny part I guess? All four grandparents are super healthy. We have the mother&#8217;s mother, who is exactly like her. Then we have the mother&#8217;s father, who is secretly gay and dating the father&#8217;s father, who is married to the father&#8217;s mother (and had a child with her) in order to hide their sexuality, as she is a lesbian (they had to hide it because old-times) and has a girlfriend.</p>



<p>Now let&#8217;s talk time. The story will start around December 2021, exactly the same time as it launches and it will progress at approximately the same pace as reality.</p>



<p>And the space-time continuum can&#8217;t work without space so let&#8217;s talk locations. The story will take place canonically in Catalonia, except maybe for vacations (although IDK if they are actually going to go abroad). The two brothers and two parents will live in the northern city of Girona, while the big brother and the mother&#8217;s parents will live in Barcelona, the capital. The father&#8217;s parents will live in a grape farm in the South, and the mother&#8217;s father will spend most of the time working there.</p>



<p>I hope everything makes sense and it isn&#8217;t a bit overkill or anything. Any suggestion you may have, direct it to me (contact details are in the footer)</p>
